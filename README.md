## Nice to see you 
I'm Z11xe

## About me 📖
I'm not very good at programming, I'm just doing this for fun as a hobby when I have free time

## Future goals 🚀
I just hope I'll be better at programming by just trying stuff out

## Fun fact ✨
Do you know that I'm a complete idiot? (Nah just joking, I'm only partially an idiot)

## Setup 🖥️
I'm coding on my core 2 duo PC with 3gb of ram and a hard drive, yes it's painful to use how did you figure that out? (Yes my own phone is more powerful than it, so I sometimes do small changes to files on it rather than on my computer)
